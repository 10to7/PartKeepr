What is PartDB2?
----------------

PartDB2 is an electronic part inventory management software. It helps you to keep track of your available parts and assist you with re-ordering parts. PartDB2 is designed for hackerspaces with multiple users, but you can also use it to manage your personal electronic part inventory.
