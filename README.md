What is PartKeepr?
----------------

PartKeepr is an electronic part inventory management software. It helps you to keep track of your available parts and assist you with re-ordering parts. PartKeepr is designed for hackerspaces with multiple users, but you can also use it to manage your personal electronic part inventory.

Project Status
--------------

This project is currently in pre-alpha stage. The code is currently pretty messy, there's not much documentation so far.
Also please note that this project uses components I've used in earlier projects, which are based on earlier projects...
you get the point.

A very big "thank you" goes out to Georgyo of NYC resistor - although he claimed that he isn't creative, he invented
the name "PartKeepr" which eventually became the project's name.
