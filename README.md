What is PartDB2?
----------------

PartDB2 is a project to manage an inventory of electronic parts. Usually, electronic geeks have a lot of electronic
components, and have trouble finding them.

Project Status
--------------

This project is currently in pre-alpha stage. The code is currently pretty messy, there's not much documentation so far.
Also please note that this project uses components I've used in earlier projects, which are based on earlier projects...
you get the point.
