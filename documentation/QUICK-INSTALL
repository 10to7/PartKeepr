The project is in a pre-alpha state. It's more a sketch or a draft than a
working product. Most of the documentation is missing, same goes for unit tests
and code coverage.



Prequisites:
------------
* PHP 5.3 or higher
* PDO
* SOAP
* A working PEAR installation


Install the required PEAR packages:
-----------------------------------

pear config-set auto_discover 1
pear install phpunit/PHPUnit
pear channel-discover pear.phing.info
pear install phing/phing
pear install pear.doctrine-project.org/DoctrineCommon-2.0.0RC1
pear install pear.doctrine-project.org/DoctrineDBAL-2.0.0BETA4
pear install pear.doctrine-project.org/DoctrineORM-2.0.0BETA4


Verify if everything is setup correctly:
----------------------------------------
cd <installation path>
phing test-setup


Install the database and test data
----------------------------------

Create the user partdb2, password partdb2 with access to the partdb2 database 
in mysql (e.g. with phpmyadmin).

Then execute the file testing/SetupDatabase.php from the command line.
Command line is important because you need to enter "YES" to confirm
the operation.


If you add new objects (=new tables), you need to add them there also.

I know, it's ugly, but will change soon.

Username/Password is test/test, but right now the system automatically logs
you in (makes development easier). 


Building the frontend
---------------------

Type:

phing build

Then wait a minute or so, after everything is completed successfully
(remember that 777 on the whole project might be a good idea until the final
path layout has been stabilized).

You can then fire up your browser and point it to the build/ directory. Note
that you need chrome/chromium with console.log support OR Firefox with the
firebug extension. Otherwise, your browser complains about the missing
console.log function. These console.log statements are necessary for debugging
and development.

If you make changes to any file in the frontend/ directory, you need to
re-build the project. To speed up things, you can use "phing build.quick" to
skip most files you usually don't change - everything in 3rdparty and
the huge image directories.
